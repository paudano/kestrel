abstract = {MOTIVATION: Converting nucleotide sequences into short overlapping fragments of uniform length, k-mers, is a common step in many bioinformatics applications. While existing software packages count k-mers, few are optimized for speed, offer an application programming interface (API), a graphical interface or contain features that make it extensible and maintainable. We designed KAnalyze to compete with the fastest k-mer counters, to produce reliable output and to support future development efforts through well-architected, documented and testable code. Currently, KAnalyze can output k-mer counts in a sorted tab-delimited file or stream k-mers as they are read. KAnalyze can process large datasets with 2 GB of memory. This project is implemented in Java 7, and the command line interface (CLI) is designed to integrate into pipelines written in any language. RESULTS: As a k-mer counter, KAnalyze outperforms Jellyfish, DSK and a pipeline built on Perl and Linux utilities. Through extensive unit and system testing, we have verified that KAnalyze produces the correct k-mer counts over multiple datasets and k-mer sizes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: KAnalyze is available on SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/kanalyze/ CONTACT: fredrik.vannberg@biology.gatech.edu Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Smith1981,
abstract = {The identification of maximally homologous subsequences among sets of long sequences is an important problem in tnolecular sequence analysis. The problem is straightforward only if one restricts consideration to cont.igucws subsequences (segments) containing no internal deletions or insertions. The more general problem has its solution in an extension of sequence metrics (Sellers 19i.i: IVaterman el al.. 1976) developed to measure the mininlunl number of "et-cntsr' required to convert one sequence into another. These developments in t.he modern sequence analysis began with the heuristic homology algorithm of Seedleman \& Wunsch (1970) which first introduced an iterative matrix method of calculation. Sumerous other heuristic algorithms have been suggested including those of Fitch (1966) and Dayhoff (1969). More mathernat- icallg rigorous algorithms were suggested by Sankoff (1972), Reichert. ef d. (1973) and Beyer el d. (1979), but these were generally not biologically satisfjing or interpretable. Successcame with Sellers (19i4) development of a true metric measure of the distance betweef: sequences. This metric was later generalized by Waterman et al. (1976) to include deletions/insertions of arbitrary length. This metric represents the minimum number of "mutat.iona1 events'' required t,o convert one sequence into another. It is of interest to n0t.e that Smith et al. (1980) hare recently shown that under some conditions the original homology algorithm of Seedleman S. Wunsch (19iO). In this letter we extend the above ideas to find a pair of segments. one from each of two long sequences. such that there is no other pair of segments with greater similarity (homology). The similarity measure used here allows for arbitrary length deletions and insertions. =Ilgorithm},
